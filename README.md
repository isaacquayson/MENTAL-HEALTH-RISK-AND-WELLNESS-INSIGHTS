# MENTAL-HEALTH-RISK-AND-WELLNESS-INSIGHTS

## PROJECT OVERVIEW 
This project explores mental health risk factors and wellness patterns using a dataset of 8,788 individuals. As a data analyst,<br/> 
I performed end-to-end data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and built predictive models to understand<br/>
the relationships between variables like stress level, sleep, physical activity, and mental health risk.<br/>

Key insights were derived through Python-based analysis and visualized in an interactive Power BI dashboard,<br/>
highlighting trends such as the impact of sleep and support systems on anxiety and depression.<br/>
I also developed a machine learning model to predict mental health risk levels with high accuracy.<br/>

To complement the analysis, SQL was used to answer targeted business questionsâ€”such as treatment-seeking behavior by group, productivity trends, and high-risk demographics.<br/>

This project demonstrates a full-cycle data analytics process, combining data engineering, storytelling, and machine learning to support data-driven mental health interventions.<br/>

## PROBLEM STATEMENT 
1. Mental health challenges are increasingly affecting workplace productivity and individual well-being, yet early detection remains limited.<br/>

2. Organizations lack actionable insights into how factors like stress, sleep, activity, and support systems contribute to mental health risks.<br/>

3. There is a need to understand the demographic and behavioral patterns associated with high mental health risk to support early intervention.<br/>

Key questions include:<br/>

  a. Who is most at risk of mental health issues?<br/>

  b. Does seeking treatment actually improve productivity?<br/>

  c. How do gender, age, and employment status relate to mental wellness?<br/>

4. A predictive system is required to classify individuals by risk level, enabling timely support and resource allocation.<br/>

## PROJECT OBJECTIVES 

a. Analyze mental health risk patterns across demographics, behavioral factors, and employment status.<br/>

b. Identify key indicators contributing to high mental health risk, such as depression, anxiety, stress, and low social support.<br/>

c. Evaluate the relationship between treatment-seeking behavior and productivity outcomes.<br/>

d. Build and compare classification models to predict mental health risk levels.<br/>

e. Visualize critical mental health insights using an interactive dashboard for stakeholder decision-making.<br/>

f. Use SQL to extract actionable insights related to mental wellness factors.<br/>

g. Enable early identification of high-risk individuals to support targeted mental health interventions<br/>

## DATA SOURCE

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahdimashayekhi/mental-health

## TOOLS USED 

a. Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)<br/>
b. Jupyter Notebook<br/>
c. SQL (MySQL)<br/>
d. Power BI<br/>
e. Microsoft Excel (for data preview)<br/>

## METHODOLOGY

1. Data Collection: Used a structured dataset containing demographic, behavioral, and mental health indicators for 10,000 individuals.<br/>

2. Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed invalid entries (e.g., physical_activity_days = 0), standardized categorical values.<br/>

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis to uncover patterns and correlations.<br/>

4. Feature Engineering: Encoded categorical variables and normalized numerical features.<br/>

5. Modeling: Trained Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree models to classify mental health risk levels.<br/>

6. Evaluation: Compared model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.<br/>

7. Dashboarding: Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize insights.<br/>

8. SQL Analysis: Executed targeted queries to answer business-related mental health questions.<br/>

## KEY FINDINGS AND INSIGHTS 

a. A significant portion of the population has a history of mental health issues(30.4%), and many seek treatment(40%).<br/>

b. Higher stress levels are associated with lower sleep quality.<br/>

c. On-site work environments show a higher frequency of mental health issues compared to remote work.<br/>

d. Males and non-binary individuals are more likely to be categorized as "high risk" for mental health concerns.<br/>

e. Unemployed individuals tend to have slightly higher mental health challenges compared to employed individuals.<br/>

f. Self-employed individuals appear to experience varied mental health challenges, often influenced by isolation or workload stress.<br/>

g. The Decision Tree Classifier outperformed other models with perfect scores (100%) across all metrics, indicating strong predictability.<br/>

h. The main factors causing mental health risk are the work environment, stress level, sleep hours, and depression score<br/>


## RECOMMENDATIONS 

a. Employers, especially those with on-site staff, should enhance mental health support programs to mitigate risks.<br/>

b. Encourage regular physical activity among employees as it is linked to reduced anxiety and stress levels.<br/>

c. Provide targeted mental health interventions for males and non-binary individuals who are at higher risk.<br/>

d. Promote mental health awareness in self-employed and remote work settings to combat isolation-driven stress.<br/>

e. Increase access to social support programs, as they are linked to reduced mental health risks.<br/>

f. Encourage balanced work-life schedules to improve sleep quality and reduce stress.<br/>

g. Adopt predictive analytics using decision tree models for early detection of mental health risks.<br/>


## CONCLUSION

The analysis revealed strong relationships between mental health risk and factors such as sleep duration, stress level, physical activity, and social support.<br/>
Individuals with lower social support, higher stress, and less than 6 hours of sleep were more likely to be at high risk.<br/>
Treatment-seeking behavior was associated with improved productivity, highlighting the importance of early intervention.<br/>
The Decision Tree model achieved the highest accuracy in predicting mental health risk, making it suitable for identifying at-risk individuals.<br/>
This project demonstrates the value of data-driven approaches in supporting mental wellness initiatives,<br/>
allowing organizations and healthcare providers to make informed, proactive decisions.<br/>
